## Why choose me?

üî•**Drive**

The main reason why I decided to become a software engineer is my belief that we live in exciting times of extreme scientific and technological revolution driven by coders. And I didn't want to stay on the sidelines. I've very curious and passionate about design, science, technology. And I want to build things that improve people's lives. All that makes me work extra hard, constantly learn and improve my coding skills.


üé®**Design & creativity**

Working as a graphic and web designer for the last 12 years gave me the chance to develop skills & work on the projects in branding, web & UX design, print design and illustration. Some of the latest web projects I worked on are [https://www.athenajournal.com/](https://www.athenajournal.com/), [https://dev.athenaadvisers.com/](https://dev.athenaadvisers.com/) , \*\*[https://harvestkaplankaya.com/](https://harvestkaplankaya.com/)

My design training has been a valuable asset that I've been able to apply to my coding projects. In addition to web design skills, structural thinking & planning, user-centered mindset and focus on business goals, alteration of divergent and convergent thinking ‚Äì all that helped me better understand the context of the project and propose solutions that would lead to a better product.


üëÖ**Communication**

In my previous roles communication skills where pivotal. A big part of my job was liaising with clients to get the project requirements, conveying the objectives to the team and then presenting design solution to the stakeholders. These skills were further improved during my time at Makers Academy due to emphasis placed on pairing and teamwork.


ü§ì**Fast and independent learning**

While in university getting my first degree in Economics & Finance I was teaching myself marketing and advertising, as that became my passion at the time. After that I transitioned into graphic design, followed by branding and then web and UX design. Learning is my passion and something that brings meaning to my life.

One of the reason why I decided to become a software engineer is because you have to learn all the time, as technologies are constantly evolving. It's truly exciting.


ü§ù**Team spirit**

I enjoy working in small teams, comfortable in both leadership and "team-player" positions. At my previous role I manage a small team of designers and worked as a part of marketing team.

For my first group project at Makers (building a clone of AirBNB) I facilitated daily standups and retros, ensuring that our group kept our eyes on the objective we set when we started.

At Makers I enjoyed daily paring session and team projects where I always try to share my knowledge and support my partners. Here's some feedback I receive:

> Very good at explaining concepts and ideas - I found this very helpful. Implements the lessons very well to get in good habits.

> Best pairing session I've had so far! You were so generous with your knowledge and infinitely patient with my slow pace. I really appreciated the time you took to make sure I understood everything. You made me feel really comfortable and relaxed and the kinder egg was a massive winner :D

> It was a pleasure pairing with you. I felt I learned a lot. Cheers :)

Also I enjoy organising fun and team building activities such as board game events, escape room runs and improve workshop at my previous job and at Makers.
